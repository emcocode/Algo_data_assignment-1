Hello!

The files in this ZIP are the code, the report and visualization programs (in python), for viewing the results.

To run the code, make sure the files are in the same folder and run them through your IDE. Also make sure to open the entire folder in the IDE to access the other classes (can be done using the command "code ." in git bash, while located in this folder). I have been using VSCode for the development.

Problem4 and Problem7 are the programs that run the Union finds as well as the 3sums. In both, the number of repetitions can be edited in variables and arrays, as well as array size and unions etc.. 

Problem3 is basically a useless class, created to test the timer. It will remain in the submission however. The class that holds the timer functionality is the TimeMeasuring class.
