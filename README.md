# Assignment 1 in Algorithms and datastructures

Problem4 and Problem7 are the programs that run the Union finds as well as the 3sums. In both, the number of repetitions can be edited in variables and arrays, as well as array size and unions etc.. 

Problem3 is basically a useless class, created to test the timer. It will remain in the submission however. The class that holds the timer functionality is the TimeMeasuring class.
